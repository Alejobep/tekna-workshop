# Apache Cassandra Hands-on
In this tutorial you will learn:
1. How to set up a single Cassandra instance
2. How to define tables in Cassandra
3. How to query data in Cassandra
4. How to set up a cluster of Cassandra nodes
## Requirements
- Docker (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker)

## Step 1: Create a directory or clone the project
Create a directory named Cassandra-single and enter the directory (this will be our working directory by now).
```sh
mkdir cassandra-single
cd cassandra-single
```

## Step 2: Define a single Cassandra node
Create a docker-compose file `docker-compose.yml` where you will define the docker container for one single instance of Cassandra.

The `docker-compose.yml` should look like this (you can use any text editor like `vi`, `nano` and `WordPad` or GUI to write the compose file). You can find an example in [docker-compose-single.yml](docker-compose-single.yml) or do `cp docker-compose-single.yml docker-compose.yml`:
```yml
version: '3'

networks:
  tutorial:
    name: tutorial

services:
  cassandra:
    image: cassandra:latest
    networks:
      - tutorial
    ports:
      - "9042:9042"
```
Save the file and close the editor.


## Step 3: Let's run Cassandra
To run the cluster using Docker (using `-d` to detach the container from the terminal). The docker compose file must be named `docker-compose.yml`
```sh
docker compose up -d
```

Let's check if we can connect by opening an interactive query shell:

```docker
docker run --rm -it --network tutorial nuvo/docker-cqlsh cqlsh cassandra 9042 --cqlversion='3.4.6' 
```
You can type `exit` to leave.

To check that Cassandra is running
```sh
docker compose ls
```

You should see something like:

```
NAME                STATUS              CONFIG FILES
cassandra           running(1)          D:\teckna\big-data-workshop\cassandra\docker-compose.yml
```

To check the configuration of your container running Cassandra :

```sh
docker compose ps
```

You should see something like:
```
NAME                    COMMAND                  SERVICE             STATUS              PORTS
cassandra-cassandra-1   "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   cassandra           running             7000-7001/tcp, 7199/tcp, 9160/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9042->9042/tcp
````

## Step 4: Cassandra is running but we want to see the DB
You will stop Cassandra and extend the docker compose to add a new service to visualise Cassandra

To stop the cluster using Docker
```sh
docker compose down
```

Let's add a new service for visualising Cassandra as in [docker-compose-gui.yml](docker-compose-gui.yml)

```yml
version: '3'

networks:
  tutorial:
    name: tutorial

services:
  cassandra:
    image: cassandra:latest
    networks:
        - tutorial
    ports:
      - "9042:9042"
    environment:
      CASSANDRA_PASSWORD: cassandra
      CASSANDRA_BROADCAST_ADDRESS: cassandra
      CASSANDRA_LISTEN_ADDRESS: cassandra
      LOCAL_JMX: "no"

  cassandra_web:
    image: basraven/cassandra-web
    networks:
      - tutorial
    ports:
      - target: 3000
        published: 8000
    environment:
      CASSANDRA_HOST: cassandra
      CASSANDRA_USER: cassandra
      CASSANDRA_PASSWORD: cassandra
    depends_on:
      - cassandra
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Now you can open the browser and see your Cassandra instance (this can take around 5 minutes to connect with Cassandra).

>http://localhost:8000


## Step 5: Load some data and query

This step can be done either from a command line or using the UI at http://localhost:8000 .

From the command line. First we need to run the CQL shell: 

```docker
docker run --rm -it --network tutorial nuvo/docker-cqlsh cqlsh cassandra 9042 --cqlversion='3.4.6'
```

Cassandra uses keyspaces to organise the data store. Similar to namespaces in other databases. By executing the folling sentence, you can create a keyspace named `store`. This keystore has replication factor 1, meaning that there will be a single copy of the data in our database. Higher replication factor will create more copies of the data, this is particularly interesting for replicating data in a cluster.

```sql
CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS store WITH REPLICATION = { 'class' : 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : '1' };
```

Cassandra is a schema-based database, thefore you need to define the data structure. In this case, a shopping cart class:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class shopping_cart{
      +text userid
      +int item_count
      +timestamp last_update_timestamp
    }
``` 
To create this class, you can execture the following sentence:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS store.shopping_cart (
userid text PRIMARY KEY,
item_count int,
last_update_timestamp timestamp
);
```
To add some transactions, you can use the following sentence:

```sql
INSERT INTO store.shopping_cart (userid, item_count, last_update_timestamp) VALUES ('9876', 2, toTimeStamp(now()));
INSERT INTO store.shopping_cart (userid, item_count, last_update_timestamp) VALUES ('1234', 5, toTimeStamp(now()));
```
You can visualise these rows by executing:
```sql
SELECT * FROM store.shopping_cart;
```

## (Optional) Step 6: Create a cluster
**Creating a cluster of two or more nodes requires a lot of resources, it may not run on your computer.**

```yml
version: '3'

networks:
  tutorial:
    name: tutorial

services:
  cassandra1:
    image: cassandra:latest
    networks:
        - tutorial
    ports:
      - "9042:9042"
    environment:
      CASSANDRA_CLUSTER_NAME: cassandra-cluster
      CASSANDRA_PASSWORD: cassandra
      CASSANDRA_PASSWORD_SEEDER: "yes"
      LOCAL_JMX: "no"
  
  cassandra2:
    image: cassandra:latest
    networks:
        - tutorial
    ports:
      - target: 9042
        published: 9043
    environment:
      CASSANDRA_CLUSTER_NAME: cassandra-cluster
      CASSANDRA_PASSWORD: cassandra
      CASSANDRA_SEEDS: cassandra1 
      LOCAL_JMX: "no"
    depends_on:
      - cassandra1

  cassandra_web:
    image: basraven/cassandra-web
    networks:
      - tutorial
    ports:
      - target: 3000
        published: 8000
    environment:
      CASSANDRA_HOST: cassandra1
      CASSANDRA_USER: cassandra
      CASSANDRA_PASSWORD: cassandra
    depends_on:
      - cassandra1
      - cassandra2
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## (Optional) Step 7: Visualise the cluster

Now you can open the browser and see your Cassandra instance. This time you will see two nodes.

>http://localhost:8000


## Step 8: Playground
## Trobleshooting
### Checking the logs
To check the logs of a container an see what is happending or the errors use:
```sh
docker compose logs <container-name>
```

### Default docker IP address
In windows you can check the address of your docker engine by opening Docker Desktop and going to settings. There go to Resources > Network
